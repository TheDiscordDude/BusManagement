## Description

This is a project done as an exercise for my university. 
The program builds a bus network from the 2 files present in the folder.
The objective of the program is to find 3 different paths between 2 bus stops.

- The first result is the **SHORTEST** path, i.e. the path with the least amount of edges in it.
- The second result is the **FASTEST** path, i.e. the path will take the less amount of time
- The last result is what we call the **FARMOST** path. It is not the fastest not the shortest, but something in between.

#### Technologies

To create this project, It used Java 15 SDK.
So you should be able to run it without problem with version >= 15.

## How to use

If you want to use the program you have to pass 3 arguments to it : 
- The Starting point: the bus stop you want to go from
- The destination (pretty self-explanatory)
- The Date and time you wish to go for example : 2022-04-12-07:00. Please Take in account that it does not support multi-days travel.

#### Installation

You just need to clone the project to a directory : 

`git  clone https://github.com/TheDiscordDude/BusManagement`

Then build it. It personally used Intellij Idea to do it without the CLI.
